>"Everyone knows a Joe"

We've all heard the above quote, but do we all actually know a Joe? The purpose of anythingJoes is to connect "seekers" with Joes in their area. This is not only for online social reasons, but a Joe's free time will also be made available if you need an extra player for that kickball tournament. Each Joe will have the ability to create their "about me", have an image gallery, and a video section so that you know you're befriending the right one.

## Getting Started
1. Pull the repository from [here](https://github.com/joetid09/anythingJoes)

2. Go into the chosen directory, and type:
    * npm start

3. You will see a localhost URL, copy and paste this into your browser

4. Enjoe the app! ðŸ™„
